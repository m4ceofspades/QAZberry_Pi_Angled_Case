# QAZberry_Pi_Angled_Case

This is a  angled screen case remix of the original case by whydobearsxplod (https://github.com/gleorepo) for the QAZberry Pi. Additional hardware requirements beyond the initial material list are as follows

(1) power switch https://www.amazon.com/uxcell-SS12F32-G7-Position-Switch-Solder/dp/B007QAJWYW/ref=sr_1_20?

(1) m2.5x20mm, (1) m2.5x12mm, (4) m2.5x4mm screws https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B082XPZV1V/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1

(4) m2.5 inserts https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07NBQ6NHL/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1

(6) m3 inserts https://www.amazon.com/Products-Inc-Fitting-Injection-Molding/dp/B07NBTCHP1/ref=dp_prsubs_2?pd_rd_i=B07NBTCHP1&psc=1

(6) m3 screws (length depends on the thickness of your weight)

(1) Plate

(1) Weight (optional but recommended)

Some wire and dupont connectors, make sure the wire you use from the amp ripper 5v to the raspberry pi header can carry 3A, I used 20awg solid core but this is a good reference (https://www.engineeringtoolbox.com/wire-gauges-d_419.html) make sure you check the core number if using stranded.

Files have been tested my myself on my printer, results on your printer may vary and need adjustment. The print files require supports.

A plate and weight dxf have been included for these to be sourced from a vendor of your choosing.
